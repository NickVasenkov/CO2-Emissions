THE IDEAS YET TO TRY:


## Time-Series

Cycles forecast

One of possible strategies (separately for each Group):

-) Calculate lags for the training set
-) Calculate lags for the first row of the cv set
(we need just the rows from the training set for this)
-)  Fit the model to the whole training set + 1 row of the cv set
-) Predict for the 1st row of the cv set
-) Now we can calculate lags for the second row of the cv set, etc.
Then we can compare prediction with real residues
if Cross-val score is high, then do the same with the test set


## Submit best by cross-val and best by test

## OFFTOPIC
for spaceship-try residuals
check steps like tuning and filling NaNs with Test Accuracy
