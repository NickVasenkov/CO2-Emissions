THE IDEAS YET TO TRY:


second seasonality removal

then cycles 

## after calculating trend-seasonality-cycles, use predictions as a new feature for part 1


## A third approach:

--look at the yearly patterns: are there shifts or the patterns align?

Use Trend from Part 2 to calculate AvgYearlyGrowth (TrendSlope * 53)

for each location and week of the year: calculate MedianAmongYears and save the YearOfMedian (if year is missing, then 2020)

prediction = MedianAmongYears + AvgYearlyGrowth * (year - YearOfMedian)

maybe, use predictions as a new feature for part 1


## Submit best by cross-val and best by test

## OFFTOPIC
for spaceship-try residuals
check steps like tuning and filling NaNs with Test Accuracy
