THE IDEAS YET TO TRY:

Part 1
tuning / different models

Part 3

Max_x_features_by_groups

Part 4



## Naive blending of the best predictions (1_09(?), 1_14(test),  2_04, 3_02 or 3_03)

More features to consider: encoded features for week, location, group, week+location, important features from Part 1

- Prepare predicitons as features
- Do hyperparameter tuning for the choice of features (with get_score function)
- Check Test RMSE
- With the best set, Do hyperparameter tuning on parameters
- Check Test RMSE
- With the best params, again, Do hyperparameter tuning for the choice of features
- Check Test RMSE
...
If there is a new feature, it can be added at the end to feature search, instead of starting from scratch.



## Submit best by cross-val and best by test

## OFFTOPIC
for spaceship-try residuals
check steps like tuning and filling NaNs with Test Accuracy
