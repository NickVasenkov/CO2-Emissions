THE IDEAS YET TO TRY:


Time-Series data:
-) try different numbers of Fourier pairs

Missing values:
-) historical data can be used
-) geolocation can be used
-) kNN or MICE, starting from the least missing

# BUT: Consider normalization first, seems to be important both for MICE and kNN

Geographical data: 
- Location clusters
